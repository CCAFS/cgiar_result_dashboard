UoW-M is developing in this project a microfluidic molecular pathogen detection system based on isothermal amplification that can be used in the field. It will be loaded with targets for major potato, sweetpotato, yam and banana viruses. If validated the tool can be applied for international phytosanitation, surveillance and monitoring or quality control in seed systems. UoW-M brings in expertise on diagnostic hardware development that we were completely lacking and which can be complementary to other tools developed in this cluster."
