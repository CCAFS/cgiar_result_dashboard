LLL adoption at farm level is influenced by land size and quality, tenure system, availability of farm machinery (tractor), access to finance and farm cooperatives, gender of household head, level of education and training and access to extension services. These factors play a role in LLL scaling strategies aiming to generate large social, economic, and environmental benefits.

positive impact on household income and welfare. CSA adoption increased
households’ total value of livestock holding by between USD 4,200 and USD
5,285. It increased the value of agricultural yield per household by between
USD 886 and USD 1,068. The impact of CSA adoption on household welfare, as
