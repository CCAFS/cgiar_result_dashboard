In many cases, yields and total factor productivity (TFP) gains were significantly higher for women rice farmers than for men (e.g. average TFP of rice farming increased by 38% for women and 25% for men in a study in Benin. However, there appeared to be a decreasing trend in the impact on yield observed over the years, estimated at 0.03 tons per ha per year. This is probably due to farmers saving their own poor-quality seed and not buying new certified seed. (Reported by RICE)",

The impact varied seasonally. During the abundance period, (first 3–4 months after harvest), 33% of households that adopted NERICA varieties and 25% of those that adopted other improved rice varieties shifted from ‘poor food consumption’ to ‘acceptable food consumption’. During the scarcity period (3–4 months before harvest, the proportion of households lifted out of food insecurity, due to the adoption of any improved rice variety, increased to 45%. These numbers correspond to about 300,000 households in sub-Saharan Africa lifted out of food insecurity in the abundance period and 900,000 households in the scarcity period. (Reported by RICE)",
