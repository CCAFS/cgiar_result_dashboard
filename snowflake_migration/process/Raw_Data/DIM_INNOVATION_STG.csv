For policy research, this could include the identification and testing of policy options.  For technologies and varieties, this means that the innovation has been tested under ideal or controlled conditions such as laboratory, greenhouse or confined settings (for example on-station)."
2,1,1900-01-01 00:00:00,2200-01-01 00:00:00,2,"Stage 2: successful piloting (PIL - end of piloting phase)","(not relevant for all innovations) - The innovation has completed the piloting phase.   The technology or practice has successfully completed broader testing under conditions intended to resemble those that the potential users of the new technology will encounter. The innovation has achieved a documented ‘real world’ assessment of potential performance and feasibility.  This may or may not mean that the innovation is immediately available for use.  "
3,1,1900-01-01 00:00:00,2200-01-01 00:00:00,3,"Stage 3: available/ ready for uptake (AV)","The innovation is ready to be taken up by next users or end users. All conditions, such as licensing, certification, and regulatory approvals have been met so that end users (e.g. farmers, service providers) are able to use and disseminate the innovation legally. If an innovation made available for uptake in a previous year has increased its geographic scope (e.g. certification and release in a new country) it can also be included here.  "
4,1,1900-01-01 00:00:00,2200-01-01 00:00:00,4,"Stage 4: uptake by next user (USE)","The innovation has demonstrated uptake by next users. This includes any support for, or adoption by public, private or non-governmental institutions. It does not include uptake by end users (the underlying logic here is that next users are much easier to count/evidence, and that it would be very unusual to have uptake by end users at scale without involvement of any next users).  To report stage 4 requires an outcome case study ."
