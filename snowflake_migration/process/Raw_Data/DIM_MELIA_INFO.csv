The intervention embeds a preventive package of behavior change modification and small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) for young children. IFPRI evaluated the impact on participation in screening and referral, uptake of, and adherence to treatment; the prevalence and incidence of acute malnutrition; feeding practices and appropriate use of SQ-LNS; and linear growth and anemia.

Improving productivity, socio-economic and environmental performance of aquaculture is an imperative to tapping these opportunities. An integrated assessment of on-farm performance of improved tilapia strains is important to identify ways through which aquaculture contributes to the five impact areas prioritized in the CGIAR research agenda to 2030, namely food security and nutrition, poverty, gender equity, environment, and climate change. In light of this, a digital tool for on farm performance assessment of aquaculture systems has been developed and made available for use in FISH CRP focal and scaling countries and by other stakeholders such as public and private sector. This with the scope to achieve consistency, comparability and effectiveness of research and data delivered around on-farm performance of aquaculture systems.  Following this approach an integrated assessment of on-farm performance of improved tilapia strains is important to identify improved tilapia strains was implemented in three countries including Bangladesh (assessment) Myanmar (baseline), and Egypt (baseline). In all three countries, the surveys looked further production and profitability of improved strains of tilapia in farming condition and examined employment by gender, food security and dietary diversity, and adaptation to climate change. Important environmental aspects include management of pond water and pond waste as well as energy use. For all the three studies a journal article will be published in 2020.

Households using ecopond technology achieve more income from Ecopond and a higher women's empowerment, measured through Women's empowerment in agriculture index (WEAI). As the Ecopond’s fish stock develops, it has the potential to strengthen household resilience to face periods of food insecurity.

Using DNA-fingerprinting based varietal identification as a benchmark, the study finds that misclassification in self-reported adoption status is considerable, with significant false negative and positive response rates. It shows that such errors lead to welfare estimates that are biased and substantially understate the poverty reduction effects of adoption. Results point to the need for improved monitoring of the dissemination process of improved varieties through innovative adoption data collection approaches to generate robust evidence for prioritizing and justifying investments.","IITA","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2019.101742 ",

The first two were on resource recovery and reuse in Ghana and Sri Lanka, and on WLE’s water and soil outcomes in Ethiopia. This evaluation concerns a significant policy outcome, specifically the CRP contribution to the incorporation of an approach to solar irrigation – solar power as a remumerative crop (SPaRC) – in two government programs: the Indian government’s USD 50 billion Kisan Urja Shakti evam Utthan Mahabhiyan (KUSUM) initiative and the Gujarat State government’s Suryashakti Kisan Yojana (SKY) scheme. The intention of KUSUM, the bigger of the two programs, is to help 2 million farmers adopt SPaRC by 2022 in expectation of much wider adoption thereafter. 
The IWMI (International Water Management Institute)-Tata Water Policy Research Program (ITP) has worked on SPaRC since 2012 with support from WLE and CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), among others. WLE and CCAFS decided to jointly commission this evaluation to better document and understand their respective contributions to the outcome, as well as to gain a sense of the likely impact of SPaRC under different adoption and usage scenarios. 
The primary intended users of the evaluation are decision makers in WLE and CCAFS who are interested in better understanding how CGIAR research and other forms of intervention contribute to policy outcomes. Intended users also include staff from donor organizations; staff from other CGIAR Research Programs (CRPs); and national partners and stakeholders working to scale up beneficial technologies and institutions. More generally, the report’s findings and conclusions will be relevant to anyone who wants to better understand mechanisms by which research can contribute to developmental impact. 

In addition, as part of an Outcome Evaluation of Climate-Smart Research on Solar-Powered Irrigation in India, a simulation model was constructed with the objective of developing a scenario-building model of the main factors influencing adoption, major costs, benefits and risks associated with solar-powered irrigation. The main focus of the evaluation was on the solar power as a remunerative crop (SPaRC) model, also known as KUSUM-C under the multibillion-dollar Kisan Urja Shakti evam Utthan Mahabhiyan (KUSUM) initiative of the Government of India. The main objectives of the simulation modeling component were to: (i) project income and environmental benefits of the SPaRC scheme over the next 20 years; (ii) identify variables to which benefits are particularly sensitive; (iii) run scenario analysis for different values of sensitive variables; (iv) pinpoint what further research or actions could help to enhance adoption and outcomes, and what variables should be closely monitored; and (v) provide a learning tool that can be used to compare what actually happens with projections over time and can be continuously updated.
