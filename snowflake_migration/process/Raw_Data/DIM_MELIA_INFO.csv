The intervention embeds a preventive package of behavior change modification and small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) for young children. IFPRI evaluated the impact on participation in screening and referral, uptake of, and adherence to treatment; the prevalence and incidence of acute malnutrition; feeding practices and appropriate use of SQ-LNS; and linear growth and anemia.

Improving productivity, socio-economic and environmental performance of aquaculture is an imperative to tapping these opportunities. An integrated assessment of on-farm performance of improved tilapia strains is important to identify ways through which aquaculture contributes to the five impact areas prioritized in the CGIAR research agenda to 2030, namely food security and nutrition, poverty, gender equity, environment, and climate change. In light of this, a digital tool for on farm performance assessment of aquaculture systems has been developed and made available for use in FISH CRP focal and scaling countries and by other stakeholders such as public and private sector. This with the scope to achieve consistency, comparability and effectiveness of research and data delivered around on-farm performance of aquaculture systems.  Following this approach an integrated assessment of on-farm performance of improved tilapia strains is important to identify improved tilapia strains was implemented in three countries including Bangladesh (assessment) Myanmar (baseline), and Egypt (baseline). In all three countries, the surveys looked further production and profitability of improved strains of tilapia in farming condition and examined employment by gender, food security and dietary diversity, and adaptation to climate change. Important environmental aspects include management of pond water and pond waste as well as energy use. For all the three studies a journal article will be published in 2020.

Households using ecopond technology achieve more income from Ecopond and a higher women's empowerment, measured through Women's empowerment in agriculture index (WEAI). As the Ecopond’s fish stock develops, it has the potential to strengthen household resilience to face periods of food insecurity.

Using DNA-fingerprinting based varietal identification as a benchmark, the study finds that misclassification in self-reported adoption status is considerable, with significant false negative and positive response rates. It shows that such errors lead to welfare estimates that are biased and substantially understate the poverty reduction effects of adoption. Results point to the need for improved monitoring of the dissemination process of improved varieties through innovative adoption data collection approaches to generate robust evidence for prioritizing and justifying investments.","IITA","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2019.101742 ",

Findings suggest that migration contributes to increased off-farm income, with higher income from international migration. While men’s labour contribution declines in migrant households, women’s labour increases in the majority of production stages. Women’s salaried work declines while their unpaid work increases. Through two-stage least squares, results indicate a negative association between increased women’s work burden and rice yield. Farm inputs and hiring labour contribute to higher yield, but remittances are not generally used for this purpose.

Rotations provide higher yields, gross margins, and consumption of wheat and faba beans. This study employs two-year data from a large sample of 1230 farm households and their 2643 fields cultivated with different varieties of wheat and faba beans in the wheat-based production system of Morocco. The two-year average gross margin was 48% higher (US$537/ha extra) than wheat mono-cropping. Contrary to common expectations, adopters of wheat-faba bean rotation did not use lesser amounts of nitrogen fertilizer than those mono-cropping wheat, thereby undermining the ecological benefits of the rotation.","ICARDA","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13593-019-0602-2","https://marlo.cgiar.org/projects/Wheat/studySummary.do?studyID=3491&cycle=Reporting&year=2019"
