Second, research design aims at collecting data through 10 different tools (quantitative and qualitative) that included MSF participants, organizers, and local experts, as well as non-participants, and examines their perceptions of both effectiveness and equity outcomes.

The APSIM crop models have been globally validated and the interface allows them to be called from a simple livelihood trajectory model made in Simile.
