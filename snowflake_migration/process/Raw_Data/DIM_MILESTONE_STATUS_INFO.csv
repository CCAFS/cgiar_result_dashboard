 and support of smallholder seed multipliers in potato, sweetpotato, banana
 and cassava are ongoing in more than 20 countries in several projects, with
 all of them having a large proportion of women producers. Moreover, the seed
 producers are linked to ware producers that themselves are linked to markets
 such as sweetpotato purée processors. 
 Consequently, the RTB seed value chains are both contributing to
 improved yields from access to improved varieties with clean planting
 material, but also allowing the growth of product value chains dependent not

 Recent gender analysis of sweetpotato vine multiplication interventions in Malawi identified gender-based constraints where the institutional contexts were detrimental to women leading to them not being able to fully and independently adopt the technologies. Therefore, scaling up strategies to promote technology adoption by women should go beyond the technology itself to restructuring both the technical and nontechnical aspects of agriculture so that women can fully benefit from improved technologies. In addition, a study in Nigeria identified gender-based constraints affecting the production, processing and marketing of biofortified cassava in two states. The study proposes integration of gender-responsive strategies to further enhance the delivery of biofortified cassava products in Nigeria. Both studies contribute to develop more equitable strategies for gender-responsive delivery strategies. Understanding specific and unique constraints for men and women in different contexts is therefore important for crop breeders, extension officers and delivery managers to work more effectively with regards to impact on productivity, income, food and nutrition security.","

 Program participants, also in collaboration with HarvestPlus, are
 implementing intervention (at different stages of development) in more than
 15 countries to make biofortified crops and derived nutrient-rich food
 products more accessible to farmer households and consumers. It’s worth to
 mention that CIP is leading the SWEETPOTATO FOR PROFIT AND HEALTH INITIATIVE

 malnutrition and improve smallholder incomes in 10 million African families
 by 2020 through the effective production and expanded use of sweetpotato.","
 Research
 in Rwanda demonstrated that OFSP purée can be an economically viable, vit.A
 enhancing ingredient in commercial baked products. A study on the level of
 compliance to good manufacturing practices and food safety standards in Kenya
 showed that special attention to hygiene, microbial quality, and safety of
 OFSP purée is needed.

 To promote more gender-equitable control of productive assets and
 resources, RTB adopts gender-sensitive approaches 1) for assessing RTB value
 chains and 2) for designing inclusive value chain development interventions. Through the RTB Foods project, gender
 relevant traits of food products are being assessed to support the
 development of new varieties that meet women's needs in terms of processing
 quality. This is sought to enhance
 efficiency of transformation processes and enhance economic returns.","

 gender-differentiated user needs of cassava showed that the difference
 between cassava trait preferences expressed by women and men mostly related
 to the expertise they have on cassava-related work. Although women mentioned

One related paper was published on leaf cooling (directly related to photoassimilates transport) in heat treated beans (Deva et al. 2020) as a heat resistance mechanism. Another paper (Suarez et al., under review) recognized 3 different groups from 70 genotypes which differ in their photosynthetic acclimation upon chronic heat. All published and ready-to publish results also contain data obtained by MultispeQ (PhotosynQ, fotosynthetic efficiency, fluorescence, leaf temperater, SPAD, etc.) which orchestrate with other phenotypic data. So far, the higher specific leaf area, higher photosynthetic efficiency (enzymatic), higher stomatal conductance and more negative leaf temperature were recognized as most important traits for phenotyping bean to heat resistance. However, the data complexity require multidimensional processing. The BBACO project will continue one more year with the ABC-CIAT physiologist in collaboration with colleagues and Reading U, Rodhamstead Inst., Manchester University and Leeds U. There are 30 000 (!) pods grown under heat ready to be analyzed. Seeds (not pollen) are the final complex product of photosynthate remobilization, the 4 different seed categories (normal, deformed, aborted seeds and aborted ovules) were selected to describe different seed filling at different seed positions. Our hypothesis is that seed position and seed categories differ between resistant and sensitive genotypes upon heat (as mainly the seed closest to apex is regularly filled).

 This
 work focused on women in dairy in East Africa and agroforestry in Vietnam,
 due to the numbers of women involved. We've also supported women PhD
 fellowships for estimating emissions and supported youth initiatives in East
 Africa, Colombia and Vietnam. There has been no demand for gender-based LED
 indicators, so this milestone has been changed to support for institutional
 change and capacity building for women's participation in LED. In East
 Africa, ILRI worked with the World Bank to design gender and socially
 inclusive (including youth) livestock projects. The Kenya Dairy Board, with
 technical support from UNIQUE developed a gender mainstreaming strategy 2020–23.
 In Vietnam, 10+ organizations are using ICRAF and CARE innovations to empower
 women in coffee-based agroforestry. In Colombia, CIAT worked with extension
 groups to train youth in low-emission livestock development. An outcome study
 of the CLIFF-GRADS PhD student fellowship, which targeted 50% of fellowships
 for women, demonstrated that CCAFS investment in 54 graduate students (2011–2018,
 48% women and 52% men) led to participants' having significantly enhanced
 skills, and career options, and generated 31 publications. 80% of respondents
 applied skills and knowledge from the CLIFF-GRADS program in their work. 71%
 could initiate new ideas and innovation at their work.
 

","ILRI has advanced analysis of intersectionality for gender and youth and
worked with the World Bank to develop improved project designs; monitoring

to document learning from successful/unsuccessful impact pathways and
articulate them through IRRI institutional theory of change. Learning from the
review conducted on AWD projects implemented in the Philippines are now
compiled in a report for publication.

 targeting) assess how major drivers (like climate change, biotic stresses,
 and rural transformation) will alter MAIZE in the developing world.
 Highlights of foresight/targeting studies to inform policy:
 - Three strategic studies focused on Africa: one providing a spatial framework
 for ex-ante impact assessment of agricultural technologies (1); another assessing
 future changes and uncertainty in decision-relevant measures of East African
 climate (2) and the third assessing maize crop nutrient input requirements
 for food security (3).
 - comprehensive book reviewed the transformation of rural Africa (4) with a
 complementary paper reviewing implications for sustainable agricultural intensification
 (5).
 - Three other studies analyzed specific innovations: potential of
 site-specific extension services and high-input agriculture in Nigeria (6);
 an ex-ante assessment for scaling conservation agriculture in Zambia (7) and
 the potential of biofortified maize for child nutrition in southern Ethiopia
 (8).
 - Two papers focused on stresses: one assessing the threats of Tar Spot
 Complex disease of maize in the USA and its global consequences (9) and the
 other assessing weather shocks and spatial market efficiency in Mozambique
 (10).
 - comprehensive manual provides a guide to scaling soil and water
 conservation in the Western Highlands of Guatemala (11).

 Market/value chain development refines the
 understanding of agri-food systems and develops a strategic nutritional
 agenda for CRP MAIZE to support identification of priorities and effective
 interventions. Highlights of markets/value chain studies to enhance last mile
 linkages:
 -Case studies assessed implications for designing interventions in Malawi's
 value chains for improved health and nutrition (1) and distribution systems
 for grain-protectants and hermetic grain-storage bags in Zimbabwe (2).
 -Review assessed Africa’s maize-based foods in terms of processing
 practices(3).
 -Two studies assessed maize seed systems – one reviewed relations between
 farmers’ seed demand and research methods (4) and the other provided a value
 chain analysis of maize hybrid seed by public-private sector in Bihar, India (5).
 -Two studies looked into mechanization – one provided a review
 of agricultural mechanization and its implications for reduced tillage (6)
 and the other assessed willingness to pay for scale-appropriate mechanization
 in Nepal(7)
 -Three studies looked at input supply and service
 dimensions – including irrigation and water markets in Bangladesh (8), heterogeneity in willingness to pay for fertilizer in Nepal (9) and the
 role of informal farmland rental markets for smallholders’ well-being in
 Malawi (10).
 -Ongoing review with visiting fellow assesses nutritional opportunities for
 MAIZE (in progress for 2020)

The first partner, Kakira Sugar Company, is a private sector sugar processing company that partnered with PIM to pilot a program that encourages the registration of sugar contracts in women’s names to increase women’s participation in the sugarcane value chain. Through qualitative work, PIM researchers identified a series of cumbersome procedures that were creating barriers for women to contribute to sugarcane production. In response, Kakira Sugar Company altered many of their practices, which led to an increase in the number and share of their women clients. The second partner is Tropical Bank, a private sector bank that partnered with PIM to provide bank accounts for contracted sugarcane producers – a requirement of some sugarcane processing companies including Kakira Sugar Company. Through qualitative work, PIM researchers identified a series of barriers that made it difficult for women to open their own accounts. In response, Tropical Bank adjusted their account-opening policies to facilitate account openings by women, which led to an increase in the number and share of their women clients.",,,,,

The Glazoue Rice Innovation Platform set up around the GEM parboiling facility in 2015 in Benin has made significant progress in upgrading along the value chain trajectory.","IRRI published research findings in Scientific Reports on post-harvest losses and carbon footprint in Myanmar. The article demonstrates that mechanized practices increased net income by 30-50% compared with traditional practices. Despite using additional energy for machine manufacturing and fuel consumption, the mechanized practices significantly reduced postharvest losses and did not increase the total life-cycle energy and greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing rice postharvest losses is one of the major achievements of the Vietnam Sustainable Agriculture Transformation Project (VnSAT), 2017-2020. IRRI’s contribution over the past 4 years has helped increase the productivity and profitability of Vietnam’s farmer associations” said MARD Deputy Minister Dr. Le Quoc Doanh in 15 Dec 2020. The information is featured in a news article. Since its establishment, the Goronyo Rice Innovation Platform has processed around 23 tons of paddy each month, generating US$ 3,800 revenue and US$ 584 profit. A complete switch from wood to rice husk as fuel has saved an estimated $30–40 per ton of rice that would otherwise be spent on wood. In Benin, the Glazoue Rice Innovation Platform set up around the GEM parboiling facility has made significant upgrading along the value chain trajectory. The progress is captured in annual reports and a video.",,"Improved parboiling is specifically designed to improve women's welfare.","Involvement of youth is an important part of the development and piloting of improved parboiling technologies.","Capacity development is at the core of the Goronyo Rice Innovation Platform.","Research contributing to loss reduction indirectly contributes to climate change mitigation as it directly contributes to increased efficiency of scarce input use."
