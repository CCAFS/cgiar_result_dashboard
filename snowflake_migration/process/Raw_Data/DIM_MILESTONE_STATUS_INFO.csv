 checklists of Crop wild relatives (CWRs) and landraces in hotspots for the
 RTB crops have been generated. Rapid assessment surveys were carried out in
 different hotspots. For banana, in Papua New Guinea (PNG), 158 and 80
 landraces were identified in two diversity hotspot sites. For cassava, in the
 two diversity sites in Peru (North and South Corridors) the surveys revealed
 a total of 410 and 392 landraces. As
 in the case of PNG for bananas, there was a lot of overlaps in naming of the
 landraces. For potato, an inventory of
 two Peruvian potato diversity hotspots was provided in 2017, revealing a
 total of 542 and 188 potato landraces in the two sites. In 2017, the
 checklist of yam CWR and landraces in Benin was based on georeferenced
 occurrences of Dioscorea rotundata (Guinea yam) and its two wild relatives D.
 praehensilis and D. abyssinica and 469 landraces were identified. ","

 and support of smallholder seed multipliers in potato, sweetpotato, banana
 and cassava are ongoing in more than 20 countries in several projects, with
 all of them having a large proportion of women producers. Moreover, the seed
 producers are linked to ware producers that themselves are linked to markets
 such as sweetpotato purée processors. 
 Consequently, the RTB seed value chains are both contributing to
 improved yields from access to improved varieties with clean planting
 material, but also allowing the growth of product value chains dependent not

 Recent gender analysis of sweetpotato vine multiplication interventions in Malawi identified gender-based constraints where the institutional contexts were detrimental to women leading to them not being able to fully and independently adopt the technologies. Therefore, scaling up strategies to promote technology adoption by women should go beyond the technology itself to restructuring both the technical and nontechnical aspects of agriculture so that women can fully benefit from improved technologies. In addition, a study in Nigeria identified gender-based constraints affecting the production, processing and marketing of biofortified cassava in two states. The study proposes integration of gender-responsive strategies to further enhance the delivery of biofortified cassava products in Nigeria. Both studies contribute to develop more equitable strategies for gender-responsive delivery strategies. Understanding specific and unique constraints for men and women in different contexts is therefore important for crop breeders, extension officers and delivery managers to work more effectively with regards to impact on productivity, income, food and nutrition security.","

 Program participants, also in collaboration with HarvestPlus, are
 implementing intervention (at different stages of development) in more than
 15 countries to make biofortified crops and derived nutrient-rich food
 products more accessible to farmer households and consumers. It’s worth to
 mention that CIP is leading the SWEETPOTATO FOR PROFIT AND HEALTH INITIATIVE

 To promote more gender-equitable control of productive assets and
 resources, RTB adopts gender-sensitive approaches 1) for assessing RTB value
 chains and 2) for designing inclusive value chain development interventions. Through the RTB Foods project, gender
 relevant traits of food products are being assessed to support the
 development of new varieties that meet women's needs in terms of processing
 quality. This is sought to enhance
 efficiency of transformation processes and enhance economic returns.","

One related paper was published on leaf cooling (directly related to photoassimilates transport) in heat treated beans (Deva et al. 2020) as a heat resistance mechanism. Another paper (Suarez et al., under review) recognized 3 different groups from 70 genotypes which differ in their photosynthetic acclimation upon chronic heat. All published and ready-to publish results also contain data obtained by MultispeQ (PhotosynQ, fotosynthetic efficiency, fluorescence, leaf temperater, SPAD, etc.) which orchestrate with other phenotypic data. So far, the higher specific leaf area, higher photosynthetic efficiency (enzymatic), higher stomatal conductance and more negative leaf temperature were recognized as most important traits for phenotyping bean to heat resistance. However, the data complexity require multidimensional processing. The BBACO project will continue one more year with the ABC-CIAT physiologist in collaboration with colleagues and Reading U, Rodhamstead Inst., Manchester University and Leeds U. There are 30 000 (!) pods grown under heat ready to be analyzed. Seeds (not pollen) are the final complex product of photosynthate remobilization, the 4 different seed categories (normal, deformed, aborted seeds and aborted ovules) were selected to describe different seed filling at different seed positions. Our hypothesis is that seed position and seed categories differ between resistant and sensitive genotypes upon heat (as mainly the seed closest to apex is regularly filled). This detailled analysis is able sufficiently answer the question about the role of pod wall in photoassimilates redistribution and its effect on intra-pod abortion rates.",,"Not required","Not required","Not required","The focus of the milestone is indeed climate change and the response of bean under rising temperatures associated with climate change.

 This
 work focused on women in dairy in East Africa and agroforestry in Vietnam,
 due to the numbers of women involved. We've also supported women PhD
 fellowships for estimating emissions and supported youth initiatives in East
 Africa, Colombia and Vietnam. There has been no demand for gender-based LED
 indicators, so this milestone has been changed to support for institutional
 change and capacity building for women's participation in LED. In East
 Africa, ILRI worked with the World Bank to design gender and socially
 inclusive (including youth) livestock projects. The Kenya Dairy Board, with
 technical support from UNIQUE developed a gender mainstreaming strategy 2020–23.
 In Vietnam, 10+ organizations are using ICRAF and CARE innovations to empower
 women in coffee-based agroforestry. In Colombia, CIAT worked with extension
 groups to train youth in low-emission livestock development. An outcome study
 of the CLIFF-GRADS PhD student fellowship, which targeted 50% of fellowships
 for women, demonstrated that CCAFS investment in 54 graduate students (2011–2018,
 48% women and 52% men) led to participants' having significantly enhanced
 skills, and career options, and generated 31 publications. 80% of respondents
 applied skills and knowledge from the CLIFF-GRADS program in their work. 71%
 could initiate new ideas and innovation at their work.
 

","ILRI has advanced analysis of intersectionality for gender and youth and
worked with the World Bank to develop improved project designs; monitoring

developed by the GEMS team, along with support for data and information
specialists via trainings, webinars, and coordinated user testing to
demonstrate the value and use of ontologies and controlled vocabularies in
annotating data assets. Almost all Centers report using AGROVOC (controlled
vocabulary) in 2019 in repository metadata fields; several also report using
terms from the Crop, Agronomy (maintained by the Alliance Bioversity-CIAT with
support from Organize) and other ontologies, among them the Alliance, IITA,
IRRI, IWMI, CIMMYT, and CIP. The use of ontology concepts to describe variables
in datasets for enhanced interpretability and interoperability remains rarer,
with progress made by the Alliance, CIP, IITA, and IRRI. IRRI continued work to
enhance the Rice Ontology in 2019, by adding/mapping terms in IRRI 
SNP-Seek, B4R (EBS) databases and in Agroportal. Additionally, IRRI's UAV controlled
vocabulary terms were shared with the Ontologies CoP, and a pilot database
management system for UAV images and metadata was developed for automated
high-throughput phenotyping. IWMI's 2019 data reorganization and metadata
review also incorporated terminology from existing ontologies, and data
managers are considering how metadata forms may eventually verify matches
between user input terms and ontologies.",,"AGROVOC includes gender terms, initial discussions inititated on how ontology improvement might contribute our ability to derive gender-related insights from CGIAR data assets.","AGROVOC includes youth terms; need to assess how ontologies can help researchers derive youth-related insights from CGIAR data assets.","Consistent and appropriate use of ontologies requires strong capacity development efforts.","Consistent use of ontologies generates standards-compliant data, enhancing our ability to more effectively mine CGIAR data assets and apply big data techniques for insights on climate change."

 - Three strategic studies focused on Africa: one providing a spatial framework
 for ex-ante impact assessment of agricultural technologies (1); another assessing
 future changes and uncertainty in decision-relevant measures of East African
 climate (2) and the third assessing maize crop nutrient input requirements
 for food security (3).
 - comprehensive book reviewed the transformation of rural Africa (4) with a
 complementary paper reviewing implications for sustainable agricultural intensification

 Market/value chain development refines the
 understanding of agri-food systems and develops a strategic nutritional
 agenda for CRP MAIZE to support identification of priorities and effective
 interventions. Highlights of markets/value chain studies to enhance last mile
 linkages:
 -Case studies assessed implications for designing interventions in Malawi's
 value chains for improved health and nutrition (1) and distribution systems
 for grain-protectants and hermetic grain-storage bags in Zimbabwe (2).
 -Review assessed Africa’s maize-based foods in terms of processing
 practices(3).
 -Two studies assessed maize seed systems – one reviewed relations between
 farmers’ seed demand and research methods (4) and the other provided a value
 chain analysis of maize hybrid seed by public-private sector in Bihar, India (5).
 -Two studies looked into mechanization – one provided a review
 of agricultural mechanization and its implications for reduced tillage (6)
 and the other assessed willingness to pay for scale-appropriate mechanization
 in Nepal(7)
 -Three studies looked at input supply and service
 dimensions – including irrigation and water markets in Bangladesh (8), heterogeneity in willingness to pay for fertilizer in Nepal (9) and the
 role of informal farmland rental markets for smallholders’ well-being in
 Malawi (10).
 -Ongoing review with visiting fellow assesses nutritional opportunities for
 MAIZE (in progress for 2020)

They also present excellent combining ability. The parentage of these lines does not reveal the source of their traits, with the exception of one parental line with superior low fertility tolerance. These lines illustrate the importance of maintaining a large number of crosses in a breeding program, to identify serendipitous combinations.Some 123 Mesoamerican lines were developed in the drought tolerance breeding program with disease resistance and promising levels of Fe in red, black and yellow grain color classes. In the Andean program, 200 lines from a population developed for drought and BCMV resistance were evaluated in a drought and irrigated trial. Thirty-eight lines from a population developed for heat tolerance were evaluated in drought and irrigated conditions. Data needs to be analyzed to code new lines (~70) for multi-location testing. Resistance to BLCrV was identified in Mesoamerican lines; so a population was developed to backcross this trait into Andean germplasm. The population was advanced under disease pressure, evaluated in two seasons, and is now entering yield trials.More than 70 families have been developed for heat tolerance. Several were evaluated under heat in the Caribia Research Station of AgroSavia, the Colombian national program. Other populations presented modest resistance to leafhoppers. Entomological studies demonstrate resistance or tolerance to leaf miners and white flies. Initial data on Fe concentration in some lines exhibit as much as 20 ppm above the baseline. These early results highlight the great value of tapping the tertiary gene pool.11,885 tons produced in 7 countries. Increased utilization of quality seed of improved varieties. Reduced time between the release and use. Increased number of seed producers engaged and increased seed business volume. Increased linkages between seed and grain production.An initial evaluation of wild P. acutifolius under a GCDT project revealed 2 accessions (G40287 and G40056) that could withstand night temperatures of 28oC and still produce seed. Families developed from these accessions were evaluated in the greenhouse under 25oC nights, with some 30 families presenting good pod formation. Further evaluation will support the search for QTL for heat tolerance. These lines complement other interspecific lines developed in previous years, of which the line SEF 16 emerged as the best in field trials on the north coast of Colombia.Greenhouse screening using breeding lines for ALS using aggressive strains identified MAB349 and MAB359 as promising resistant genotypes. Other genotypes such as NUA184, SMN184 and NXB080 showed acceptable levels of resistance.This was adopted as a PhD research topic, and thus was not pursued within the program.An R programme facilitates data processing from MSPQ tool for heat-related photosynthate transport, performing basic statistics, reflecting behavior under heat and identifying the best 10% genotypes. MPSQ seeks multidimensional evaluation of data to understand tolerance. Artificial intelligence to evaluate seed filling in scanning bleached bean pods is in final evaluation. We also verified that tolerant genotypes under heat elongate pods rapidly and consistently during pod elongation and later in seed-filling stage. An approach to evaluate abortion with and without heat shock is being developed in growth chambers.ABC research teams in Tanzania have shown that the use of micronutrients based fertilizers increase agricultural productivity by at least 25% across crops and geographies. Beyond phosphorus, research is needed on bean response to molybdenum, zinc, boron, manganese and copper.No new markers for BGMV have been tried this year. The MAGIC population needs to be evaluated for this trait in LAC, or the BASE needs to be re-evaluated in replicated trials.","
