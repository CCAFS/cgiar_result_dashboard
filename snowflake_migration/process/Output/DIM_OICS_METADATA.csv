Since 2012, CCAFS East Africa has continuously supported agriculture and climate change negotiators and experts from Africa to prepare submissions for UNFCCC negotiations. More recently, the roadmap developed during SBSTA48 builds heavily on AGN submission. Over 10 technical working sessions have been convened with AGN, where CCAFS and CGIAR knowledge outputs provided scientific evidence to articulate vulnerability of African agriculture to climate change.

The Department of Veterinary Services in Kenya incorporated these tools into their national RVF contingency plan and also used them to implement risk-based RVF interventions. Improved control of RVF in animals would limit human infections and hence safeguard health and wellbeing of the local communities in 22 counties with high RVF risk in Kenya.
