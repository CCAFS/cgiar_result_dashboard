 checklists of Crop wild relatives (CWRs) and landraces in hotspots for the
 RTB crops have been generated. Rapid assessment surveys were carried out in
 different hotspots. For banana, in Papua New Guinea (PNG), 158 and 80
 landraces were identified in two diversity hotspot sites. For cassava, in the
 two diversity sites in Peru (North and South Corridors) the surveys revealed
 a total of 410 and 392 landraces. As
 in the case of PNG for bananas, there was a lot of overlaps in naming of the
 landraces. For potato, an inventory of
 two Peruvian potato diversity hotspots was provided in 2017, revealing a
 total of 542 and 188 potato landraces in the two sites. In 2017, the
 checklist of yam CWR and landraces in Benin was based on georeferenced
 occurrences of Dioscorea rotundata (Guinea yam) and its two wild relatives D.
 praehensilis and D. abyssinica and 469 landraces were identified. ","

 and support of smallholder seed multipliers in potato, sweetpotato, banana
 and cassava are ongoing in more than 20 countries in several projects, with
 all of them having a large proportion of women producers. Moreover, the seed
 producers are linked to ware producers that themselves are linked to markets
 such as sweetpotato purée processors. 
 Consequently, the RTB seed value chains are both contributing to
 improved yields from access to improved varieties with clean planting
 material, but also allowing the growth of product value chains dependent not
 only on raw material, but access by RTB crop producers to quality planting
 material of the appropriate varieties.","

 them will soon be released. These are Unica, locally known as Mkanano, and
 Shangii. They will be released to farmers for cultivation after proving

 to climate change, especially heat and drought are important targets in RTB

 screen banana genotypes for drought tolerance, and screening protocols are
 being perfected. Varieties are being released and further developed with
 resistances to diseases that will be affected by climate change (e.g. late

 increased heat tolerance have been tested and released in dry hot areas of

 Recent gender analysis of sweetpotato vine multiplication interventions in Malawi identified gender-based constraints where the institutional contexts were detrimental to women leading to them not being able to fully and independently adopt the technologies. Therefore, scaling up strategies to promote technology adoption by women should go beyond the technology itself to restructuring both the technical and nontechnical aspects of agriculture so that women can fully benefit from improved technologies. In addition, a study in Nigeria identified gender-based constraints affecting the production, processing and marketing of biofortified cassava in two states. The study proposes integration of gender-responsive strategies to further enhance the delivery of biofortified cassava products in Nigeria. Both studies contribute to develop more equitable strategies for gender-responsive delivery strategies. Understanding specific and unique constraints for men and women in different contexts is therefore important for crop breeders, extension officers and delivery managers to work more effectively with regards to impact on productivity, income, food and nutrition security.","

 Program participants, also in collaboration with HarvestPlus, are
 implementing intervention (at different stages of development) in more than
 15 countries to make biofortified crops and derived nutrient-rich food
 products more accessible to farmer households and consumers. It’s worth to
 mention that CIP is leading the SWEETPOTATO FOR PROFIT AND HEALTH INITIATIVE

 malnutrition and improve smallholder incomes in 10 million African families
 by 2020 through the effective production and expanded use of sweetpotato.","

 in Rwanda demonstrated that OFSP purée can be an economically viable, vit.A

 compliance to good manufacturing practices and food safety standards in Kenya
 showed that special attention to hygiene, microbial quality, and safety of
 OFSP purée is needed.

 To promote more gender-equitable control of productive assets and
 resources, RTB adopts gender-sensitive approaches 1) for assessing RTB value
 chains and 2) for designing inclusive value chain development interventions. Through the RTB Foods project, gender
 relevant traits of food products are being assessed to support the
 development of new varieties that meet women's needs in terms of processing
 quality. This is sought to enhance
 efficiency of transformation processes and enhance economic returns.","
